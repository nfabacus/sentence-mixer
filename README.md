  This is a spiked version of Sentence Scrambler to quickly deliver a MVP to our client.

## Objective
Provide a Japanese learner with a simple app to practice for her Japanese test (JLPT N5 Grammar test).

## How to use it
1. Each Japanese sentence (question) is scrambled up.
2. You will need to swap around each phrase/word to make the sentence in a correct order.
3. Press 'Check' to see if your answer is correct.

## Please test it!
You can use and test it right now at https://sentence-mixer.firebaseapp.com/
Please note that this app is intended for use by a student who knows mid/advanced level Japanese.

## Update
Oct 2, 2016: First MVP is deployed.

## Issues
- Currently, there is only one 'correct' answer to each sentence question.  But, actually, some words can be swapped around and the sentence can be grammatically correct.  I hope to address this issue later to accept different answer options.
